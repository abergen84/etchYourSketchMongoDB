#etch Your [Saved] Sketch

##Application Description

Remember that cool game growing up called Etch-A-Sketch? If you don't, you weren't
living life to the fullest. Either way, I've created a replica of the simple,
sweet game in React for the user experience. Draw something cool and wish you could
save it and come back to it later? Now you can. Using MongoDB, a backend exists to 
save and retrieve that slick sketch.

##Application Ins and Outs

Using React in combination with Backbone and MongoDB for full-stack app development.
-React for the user experience
-Backbone to handle the models and collection, in addition to controller
-MongoDB to handle the data storage and retrieval
